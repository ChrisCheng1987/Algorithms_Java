1. The algorithms heavily depends on the input model, which includes the distribution of inputs.
  For example, the sorting algorithm performance may be very different when the input does not have same key values or does.
2. There are lower bound performance of algorithms, so do not try to break the bound, which will be impossible.
  For example, the worst case of comparison sorting algorithm is NlogN, so do not try to design an algorithm which is even lower than that.
